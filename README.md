# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a weather app. I used React + Typescript + Vite. I have an API KEY on openweathermap.org

We can find a city information about today or tomorrow info via API. I used about turkey cities on the project. You can search a city and find an info of its weather

You need an API KEY on openweathermap. I used a free version.

## configuration API_KEY

If you work with my project. Note that you have defined an API KEY on api/weather.js

```
const apiKey =  'API_KEY';
```
